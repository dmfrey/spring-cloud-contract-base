# Spring Cloud Contract Base

This is a repo from which to start spring cloud contract projects as well as work through issues with contrats with 
the Spring Cloud Team.

There are already base `api` and `client` apps which demonstrate a basic flow for producers and consumers to 
implement contract-first development.
